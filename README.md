# Automatidata_Project (Google Advanced Data Analytics)

For this project, I worked on building a model that can help predict whether a rider tip taxi drivers or not. The project is broken down into different components as each component reflects my learning process of building a machine learning model - starting from cleaning and analyzing data to building a model.
