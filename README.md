# Automatidata_Taxi_Project (Google Advanced Data Analytics)

The goal of this project is to build a model that can help predict whether a rider tips taxi drivers or not. 

Throughout the project, the data is analyzed to understand factors that lead to taxi riders giving tips or not including duration of the ride and the distanced traveled.

The project is broken down into different components as each component reflects my learning process of building a machine learning model - starting from cleaning and analyzing data to building a model.
